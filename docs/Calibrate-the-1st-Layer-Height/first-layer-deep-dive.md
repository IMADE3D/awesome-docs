### First Layer Squish and the Holding Power (Deep Dive)

The matters are slightly more complicated. Spoiler alert, there's no 'perfect first layer' - it depends what you're trying to achieve. The **more you 'squish'** your first layer, the more the print will stick to the build plate. The downside is some filament overflow and oversized 1st layer also known as `elephant's foot` üêò.

This may actually be desirable. For example, if you're printing a big object with high.
