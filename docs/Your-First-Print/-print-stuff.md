## Print Stuff!

When you are happy your first layer, get out there and print something nice.

To verify, you can print the [IMADE3D First Print](go.imade3d.com/first-layer) (Our Logo with the 1st layer designed to be fast to print and easy to judge) or [IMADE3D Second Print (Part Scraper)](https://docs.imade3d.com/Guide/01.+Print+the+Part+Scraper/595?lang=en#s1777)
