### What You'll Need
- Tweezers
- Brass wire brush, optional

### Do the Clean
1. Pre-heat the nozzle to the print temperature (or a bit higher) of the last plastic you printed (e.g., 215 for PLA, 235 for PETG).
2. Wait a bit for the left-over filament to ooze out if there is any.
3. Use tweezers and/or brass wire brush to remove any debris and pieces of old filament from the nozzle.

   The nozzle can be dirty or discolored, but the tip needs to be clean.
5. Turn off the heat.
