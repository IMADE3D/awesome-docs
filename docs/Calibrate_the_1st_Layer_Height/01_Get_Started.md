## How the Z Probe Determines a Successful Print

When you print, it is imperative that the model - the object you're printing - is stuck to the build plate; only to be peeled off once the print is finished. For this, the printer needs to be able to repeatedly and precisely position the nozzle very close to the build plate so that the filament gets stuck to it as it's being extruded.

> In short, a badly set-up Z probe guarantees a bad first layer and a print failure.

Proximity sensor is a switch that becomes engaged when it comes to a specific distance from a piece of metal. In JellyBOX, the proximity sensor, also known as z-probe, plays the role of Z end stop. It senses the magnetic field of the build plate and thus determines the z homing position - just like simple mechanical switches determine the x and y homing positions. This means by adjusting the z probe, we can change the z homing position and thus also the first layer height.

## Clean the Nozzle

!> Make sure the nozzle is clean before you proceed or you're wasting your time. 

1. Pre-heat the nozzle to the print temperature of the last plastic you printed (e.g., 210 for PLA, 230 for PETG).
2. Wait a bit for the left-over filament to ooze out.
3. Use tweezers or brass wire brush to remove any debris and pieces of old filament from the nozzle. 
4. Turn off the heat.
