After testing motors, the ## Steppers are locked. Need to indicate to users that they need to unlock motors in the previous menu.

Thanks. We’ll change the software so that it’s unlocked. Until then, warning it is.

When I try to trigger the z axis, I can see the light go off underneath but it does not say “triggered” on the LCD.

Hi Elizabeth,

You need to highlight and click on the “Click to update” line while the light is off. Does this make sense? The statuses only update when you “Click to update”.

If that does not help, then there could be an issue with your wiring.

Filip Goc - March 5
Yes I did that, it was only the Z I was having trouble with. I found a loose wire leading away from the z trigger and shoved it back into place and all is good now.

## Step 17 PS:
PS: Your Preflight Check may still have items 9. Load Filament and 10. Eject Filament. Simply SKIP THESE for now. We will load and eject filament a bit later as a part of your First Print.

These functions will be removed from the Preflight Check in the future. They are identical to the Load and Eject functions available through the Material Menu.
