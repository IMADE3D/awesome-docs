8 ## Steps


## Step 1 Adjust the Z Probe Height

Move the filament fan and the Z probe above the nozzle.

Do not over-tighten these screws. No need. (Many people tend to over-tighten these screws.)





## Step 2
Make sure the nozzle tip has no plastic build up.
Make sure the nozzle tip has no plastic build up.

The nozzle can be dirty, but the tip needs to be clean.

An easy way to clean the nozzle is to heat it up to about 180°C and use tweezers or a brass brush to remove the build up.





## Step 3
Position the extruder around the middle of the build plate.

## Step 4
Slide a piece of paper underneath the nozzle.
Slide a piece of paper underneath the nozzle.

A basic office paper works fine; that's about 0.1mm thick.





## Step 5
Turn the z lead screw with your bare hand until the nozzle is lightly touching the build plate.

A proven way to do this is by touch: when you can't move the paper freely back-and-forth that's when the nozzle is touching the plate.

You don't have to worry about being crazy precise. The important thing is that you're consistent. Just get a feel for the paper. In a few calibration cycles, you'll be a master.





## Step 6
Rest the probe on a 4'' zip tie and tighten the screw to keep it in place.
Rest the probe on a 4'' zip tie and tighten the screw to keep it in place.

Since the thickness of a 4'' zip tie is about 1mm, we now have a gap between the tip of the nozzle and lower end of the z probe about 1 mm.





## Step 7
Take this opportunity to adjust the filament fan height as well.

Rest the filament fan on a 4'' zip tie and tighten the screw to keep it in place.

Good cooling is essential for quality prints from many materials. For PLA it's a must.





## Step 8
Now there should be about 1mm gap between the tip of the nozzle and the Z probe.
Now there should be about 1mm gap between the tip of the nozzle and the Z probe.

This concludes the mechanical part of the Z probe setup. When your JellyBOX probes the build plate, the probe now should be well within its sensing distance.
