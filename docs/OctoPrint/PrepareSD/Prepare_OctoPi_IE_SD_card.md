# Prepare OctoPi IMADE3D Edition SD Card From Scratch

> When done, go **[Back to Hardware Install](../2_Hardware.md)** section.

## You'll Need

*(This section may be underdeveloped, but enough to serve as a reminder for power users.)*

- **MicroSD card**. Get a good one; it makes a difference and it's cheap. According to the venerable [Jeff Geerling's](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blogs/jeff-geerling/raspberry-pi-microsd-card), *Samsung 32GB EVO Plus* card will get you the best performance. Any high grade sd card should work, at the least it should be class 10.
- A computer that can read microSD cards or some sort of reading device

## Prepare the SD Card

!> Warning: do NOT load the SD card into your Pi right after burning. You first need to set your admin password, and that can only be done once - on the first boot.

1. Download the latest OctoPi IMADE3D Edition image for your Raspberry Pi from [http://imade3d.com/resources/OctoPi-IE](http://imade3d.com/resources/OctoPi-IE). You don't have to unzip the file, but if you do, you'll see there's a single `.img` file inside.
1. Download and install **Balena Etcher** from [https://etcher.io](https://etcher.io/)
1. Burn the image onto your SD card with Balena Etcher.
1. That's it. You thought it would be more difficult didn't you? Well, we spent a lot of time and effort making this easy for you. You're welcome.
