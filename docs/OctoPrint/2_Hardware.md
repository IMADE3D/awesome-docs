# Install the RPi Hardware Into Your JellyBox

*(This section is underdeveloped, but enough to serve as a reminder for power users.)*

## What You'll Need

### Parts

?> If you purchased our [Plug and Play OctoPrint-IE KIT](https://shop.imade3d.com/3d-printer-parts-upgrades/plug-and-play-octoprint-ie-kit.html), you have all of these.

- RaspberryPi 3B+
    - Raspberry Pi 2 or 3 also work, but they are slower all around, and especially networking-wise. If you can, get the 3B+. It's not that expensive an it's better.
- High performwance 32GB microSD card pre-loaded with OctoPi IE (IMADE3D Edition)
    - You can buy one from us or [follow this guide to make your own](PrepareSD/Prepare_OctoPi_IE_SD_card.md).
- Lasercut spacers (4)
- 3D printed stand-offs (2)
- M3x45 sockethead screws (2)
- M3x12 sockethead screws (6)
- M3 Heat inserts (6)
- M3 locknuts (2)
- USB-B cable (it's the cable that came with your JellyBOX)
- RPi JellyBOX-integrated power supply + pre-crimped wiring
- Heavy duty toggle switch + pre-crimped wiring

### Tools

- 2.5mm hex key (M3)
- IMADE3D wrench
    - A pair of pliers or locking pliers will do OK as well
- Soldering iron
    - For the heat inserts. If you don't have access to one, you can use longer screws with nuts as well.
- A computer and access to your local Internet

## Install it All

!> This guide is still in the works. Please send us a message if you're in rush and need help.

Long story short: install the RPi on the inner back top right (there'a a space clearly prepared for it). You may need to first insert a few heated inserts; or use longer screws and nuts if you wish.

You will connect the 2nd power switch in series with the first one, so that it's getting power from the JellyBOX power supply and brings 5V into the RPi over microUSB. 

Connect the JellyBOX to the RPi with the blue USB cable type B.

That's it.
